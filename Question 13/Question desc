Working with 2D arrays is quite important. Here we will do swapping of columns in a 2D array. You are given a matrix M of r rows and c columns. You need to swap the first column with the last column.
Input Format: The first line of input contains T, the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line contains r and c, separated by a space. The next r lines contains c elements of the matrix, separated by spaces.
Output Format: For each testcase, in a new line, print the modified matrix.
Your Task: Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided function interchange(int ,  int ) that take rows and columns number as parameter.
Constraints: 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= r,c <= 100
Example: Input: 1 3 4 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 6 7 8 9 Output: 4 2 3 1 1 3 2 4 9 7 8 6
